    "## The Research Goal\n",
    "I want to research how the smallest job first (SJF) scheduling algorithm can be expanded upon such that longer jobs will still be able to complete, regardless of how many other smaller jobs are in the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words: \n",
    "> How can one create a starvation free implementation of the Smallest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Reasoning Behind The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this class, I explored a similar issue on a hobby level, designing a fairness-oriented queue for a supermarket scenario. In that work, I used basket size as a metric to determine queue priority, balancing efficiency with fairness. Then, a few years later in my SYNC class, I came across the SJF algorithm in a introduciton presentation, where we discussed the issue of job starvation in this particulair scheduling algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to address the challenge of starvation in SJF by adapting it to ensure that longer jobs also have the opportunity to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derived Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "The main research question is already described at the bottom of the research goal (just above). However, to make the research more structured, I will break it down into smaller questions:\n",
    "1. What is the Smallest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm?\n",
    "    1. When was it first introduced?\n",
    "    2. Why was it introduced?\n",
    "    3. How does it work?\n",
    "    4. What are some of SJF's advantages and disadvantages?\n",
    "    5. Is their an example of a real-world implementation of SJF (preferably described in pseudo code)?\n",
    "2. What is job starvation in the context of multi-tasking systems?\n",
    "    1. Why is job starvation a problem?\n",
    "    2. What are some of the ways to address job starvation?\n",
    "    3. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these solutions?\n",
    "3. How can the SJF algorithm be adapted to prevent job starvation?"

    "## Aproach\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, I’ll begin with document analysis and a literature study on SJF scheduling, gathering definitions, principles, and an example implementation (ideally in pseudocode) to establish a foundational understanding. Next, I will conduct further literature, library, and design pattern research to investigate starvation—specifically, what causes it in scheduling algorithms and how it can be prevented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, using the DOT framework pattern Realise as Expert and its associated methods, I will create a proof of concept for a starvation-free SJF algorithm. This iterative approach will help me integrate the theoretical and practical aspects necessary to design an SJF implementation that ensures all job types have an opportunity to complete."

    "\n",
    "### When was it first introduced?\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is extremly hard to pin-point the exact first mention of the SJF algorithm, we can find mentions of the underlying problems & principles for SJF as early as 1959 in the paper \"Multiprogramming STRETCH: Feasibility Considerations\" at page 14 (page 2 of the PDF source):\n",
    "> Allocation of space in core and disk storage, assignment of input-output units, and **control of time-sharing** should be based upon the needs of the programs being executed\n",
    "\n",
    "Even earlier, a mention of a binary computer suppositly supporting parallel operations was made in the paper \"A Survey Of Automatic Digital Computers 1953\" at page 6 :\n",
    "> (Automatic Binary Computer)  \n",
    "> built by: Air Force Cambridge Research Center, Cambridge, Massachusettsfirst ...  \n",
    "> ready for use: May 1953 ...  \n",
    "> ARITHMETIC MODE: Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "And, even earlier still, it is mentioned in \"The electronic numerical integrator and computer (ENIAC)\" (published circa 1946) that the ENIAC (the very first general purpose digital computer) had parallel computing capabilities. Alto I could not find any mention of conserns about optimal job scheduling from this same time, I find it highly likeley that the engineers of that time must have been just as curious about this subject as we are now. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why was it introduced?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I was unable to pinpoint exactly where in the literature I read it, there appears to be a general consensus that SJF was introduced to improve efficiency by reducing the average wait time in job scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specificly, SJF was introduced as a response to the need for efficient resource utilization in multi-tasking systems. As computing resources became increasingly shared among multiple processes, it became apparent that optimizing the order of job execution could significantly reduce overall waiting times. Prioritizing shorter tasks was seen as a way to maximize throughput by quickly clearing shorter jobs from the queue, thus minimizing idle time in the processor. This approach was especially valuable in early multiprogramming environments, where delays in task scheduling could quickly accumulate and impact system performance.\n",

    "Nowadays it is a mere part of a larger whole that is process scheduling. TODO: describe how it is currently used in task scheduling\n",
