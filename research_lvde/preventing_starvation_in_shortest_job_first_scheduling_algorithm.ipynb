In that work, I used basket size as a metric to determine queue priority, balancing efficiency with fairness. Then, a few years later in my SYNC class, I came across the SJF algorithm in a introduciton presentation, where we discussed the issue of job starvation in this particulair scheduling algorithm. \n",

    "## What is the Smallest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter uses a library study approach within the DOT-framework method to explore SJF scheduling. It systematically addresses the main question and its sub-questions by analyzing existing literature and technical resources. This includes some study on the history of SJF (and in extention parallel digital computing), examining SJF's principles, its preemptive and non-preemptive variants, advantages, disadvantages, and practical implementation considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When was it first introduced?\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is extremly hard to pin-point the exact first mention of the SJF algorithm, we can find mentions of the underlying problems & principles for SJF as early as 1959 in the paper \"Multiprogramming STRETCH: Feasibility Considerations\" at page 14 (page 2 of the PDF source):\n",
    "> Allocation of space in core and disk storage, assignment of input-output units, and **control of time-sharing** should be based upon the needs of the programs being executed\n",
    "\n",
    "Even earlier, a mention of a binary computer suppositly supporting parallel operations was made in the paper \"A Survey Of Automatic Digital Computers 1953\" at page 6 :\n",
    "> (Automatic Binary Computer)  \n",
    "> built by: Air Force Cambridge Research Center, Cambridge, Massachusettsfirst ...  \n",
    "> ready for use: May 1953 ...  \n",
    "> ARITHMETIC MODE: Parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "And, even earlier still, it is mentioned in \"The electronic numerical integrator and computer (ENIAC)\" (published circa 1946) that the ENIAC (the very first general purpose digital computer) had parallel computing capabilities. Alto I could not find any mention of conserns about optimal job scheduling from this same time, I find it highly likeley that the engineers of that time must have been just as curious about this subject as we are now. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why was it introduced?\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I was unable to pinpoint exactly where in the literature I read it, there appears to be a general consensus that SJF was introduced to improve efficiency by reducing the average wait time in job scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specificly, SJF was introduced as a response to the need for efficient resource utilization in multi-tasking systems. As computing resources became increasingly shared among multiple processes, it became apparent that optimizing the order of job execution could significantly reduce overall waiting times. Prioritizing shorter tasks was seen as a way to maximize throughput by quickly clearing shorter jobs from the queue, thus minimizing idle time in the processor. This approach was especially valuable in early multiprogramming environments, where delays in task scheduling could quickly accumulate and impact system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SJF scheduling algorithm operates using several key components:\n",
    "- Burst Time Estimator: This component estimates the burst time (the required execution time) for each process.\n",
    "- Process Queue: The queue maintains all tasks that are waiting for processing.\n",
    "- Task Manager: responsible for retrieving/returning tasks from/to the queue and monitoring tasks that are in progress. If a task is paused or needs to wait, the Task Manager returns it to the queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle continues until all tasks are completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![SJF algorithm flowchart](./sjf_flowchart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Figure 1. Illustration of the SJF algorithm's flowchart key components*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimal for minimizing waiting time\n",
    "SJF is an optimal scheduling method for minimizing average waiting time in a queue. By always selecting the job with the shortest expected processing time, SJF reduces the total time that jobs spend waiting, making it an efficient choice for systems that handle tasks of varying lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 main forms of implementation\n",
    "SJF can be implemented in two main forms: non-preemptive and preemptive. In the non-preemptive version, once a job starts, it runs to completion without interruption. In contrast, the preemptive form, also known as Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), allows for the interruption of the current job if a new job with a shorter remaining processing time arrives. This flexibility can further reduce wait times, especially in environments with high task turnover.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Burst time estimation\n",
    "A critical aspect of SJF is the need for an estimated burst time (the time a job will take to complete). As exact burst times are often unknown in advance, the algorithm relies on predictions. Common techniques for estimating burst time include analyzing historical data or using exponential averaging methods, which can help approximate processing times to improve scheduling accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some of SJF's advantages and disadvantages?\n",
    "\n",
    "SJF is a non-preemptive scheduling rule, meaning the queue is only evaluated after each job is fully completed. At that point, the job with the shortest estimated running time is selected next, reducing the overall waiting time in the system. This simplicity allows SJF to achieve a lower mean waiting time compared to other scheduling methods, like First-Come, First-Served (FCFS). However, the approach can disadvantage longer jobs, which may experience significant delays. This trade-off results in a lower average wait time but increases the variance in waiting times across jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The preemptive version of SJF, Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), can interrupt a job if a new job with a shorter remaining time arrives. This dynamic prioritization can further reduce average waiting times, especially for shorter tasks, making SRTF more responsive in interactive systems. However, SRTF introduces more overhead due to frequent context switching and does not solve the issue of starvation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summerize;\n",
    "\n",
    "SJF\n",
    "- Non-preemptive: queue is evaluated only after each job completes, ensuring jobs finish entierly before continueing.\n",
    "- Selects the job with the shortest estimated running time, reducing overall waiting time.\n",
    "- Achieves lower mean waiting time than First-Come, First-Served (FCFS).\n",
    "- Disadvantages longer jobs, which may face delays or even complete starvation.\n",
    "- Results in lower average wait time but higher variance in waiting times.\n",
    "\n",
    "SRTF\n",
    "- Preemptive: can interrupt a job if a new, shorter job arrives.\n",
    "- Reduces average waiting time further from SJF.\n",
    "- Increases responsiveness in interactive systems.\n",
    "- Introduces more overhead due to frequent context switching.\n",
    "- Also has problems with starvation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is their a example of a real-world implementation of SJF (preferably described in pseudo code)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunatly, trueought my research I have not been able to find any real world implementations of SJF. I wondered if any populair operating system (like Linux variants or perhaps older versions of Windows) might use SJF, but it seems that all the OS'es I research use a more sophisticated scheduling algorithm. From what I have been able to gather;\n",
    "- Linux Kernel version 2.5 uses the `O(1) scheduler` (page 234 of Operating System Concepts 10th edition)\n",
    "- Linux Kernel version 2.6.23 uses the `Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS)` (page 236 of Operating System Concepts 10th edition)\n",
    "- Windows Kernel (unkown version) uses a complex priority based schedular (page 239 of Operating System Concepts 10th edition)\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to time limitations and lack of experience with smaller OS'es (like once designed for arduino's for example), I am unable to do further research into possible SJF implementations in real-world systems. As such, I will be designing my own emulator (using self-made diagrams as a starting point instead of the pseudo code), in Python, of how the SJF algorithm works, whilst trying to adhear as much as possible to how an actual operating system functions. That entails using similair terminology, ensuring that all the entities are in play as would be when implemented in a OS (such as a dispatcher, use of process control block, etc.)."

    "## What is job starvation in the context of multi-tasking systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: job starvation in multi-tasking systems refers to a situation where a process or job is perpetually denied access to the resources it needs to execute and make progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- https://csc-knu.github.io/sys-prog/books/Andrew%20S.%20Tanenbaum%20-%20Modern%20Operating%20Systems.pdf -->\n",
    "Tanenbaum, Andrew (2001). Modern Operating Systems. Prentice Hall. pp. 184–185. ISBN 0-13-092641-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better illustrate what job starvation is, will we use the following scenario troughout this chapter. Suppose we have 2 threads, A and B, and a shared resource, C. Thread A is designed to perform a short task on C every time it gains access, while Thread B requires a longer time to complete its work with C. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is job starvation a problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have 2 threads, A and B, both of which need access to a shared resource C. In a system that uses the SJF as its scheduling algorithm, if infinitly many new instances of A continue to arrive in the queue before B gets to the front of the queue, B will keep getting pushed back, as the scheduler prioritizes shorter jobs. At that point, we can state that B is infinitly starving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even worse, when a system uses the preemtive version of SJF (SRTF), even if B where to get some time to run, if a new A gets put into the queue before B gets the time it needs to run to completion, B will be halted and put back into the queue. We can then, again, state that B is starving, possible infinitly long depending on the amount of A's being put into the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are some of the ways to address job starvation in SJF?\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout my research, I found that several strategies can effectively mitigate job starvation, particularly in scheduling algorithms like SJF. Among these, the most promising approaches to me seem to be:\n",
    "- Aging: Gradually increasing the priority of processes that have been waiting for a long time (page 213 of Operating System Concepts 10th edition)\n",
    "- Dynamic Time-Slicing: Introduce time-slicing for longer jobs to ensure waiting jobs periodically get execution opportunities. (Dynamic Time Slice Calculation for Round Robin Process Scheduling Using NOC)\n",
    "- Priority Queues with Minimum Thresholds: Use a separate queue for jobs at risk of starvation, ensuring their execution once they exceed a wait-time threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the advantages and disadvantages of these solutions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The following outlines the advantages and disadvantages of various strategies to address job starvation, providing real-world scenarios to illustrate how these solutions may perform in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aging:**  \n",
    "- **Advantages**: Prevents processes from waiting indefinitely by gradually increasing their priority. For example, a long simulation job in a shared lab system will eventually execute even with constant smaller job submissions.  \n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Can lead to priority inflation, where less critical tasks preempt more urgent ones. For instance, a long background job could delay interactive user queries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Time-Slicing:**  \n",
    "- **Advantages**: Ensures longer jobs get periodic execution opportunities, maintaining fairness. For example, on a web server, this allows large file uploads to progress without being completely blocked by smaller requests.  \n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Adds complexity and overhead due to frequent context-switching, which can reduce overall system performance, such as in high-performance computing environments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Priority Queues with Minimum Thresholds:**  \n",
    "- **Advantages**: Ensures that processes waiting beyond a certain time are executed. For example, critical maintenance jobs in cloud applications are handled despite continuous user-driven workloads.  \n",
    "- **Disadvantages**: Increases system complexity and may disrupt optimized scheduling, leading to inefficiencies like longer response times for regular tasks in database servers.  "

It might be a nice thing to test which has less time complexity, as well which one at the end uses the least amount of operations to get to a descision.

But using the threading library means I am relegating the descision process for which process to run to the hardware the emulation runs on. This is not what I want, I want to emulate the SJF descision making process.
