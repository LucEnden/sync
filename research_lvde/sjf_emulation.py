'''
This is a simple emulation of Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm.
The design of this emulation can be found in `diagrams.drawio` file in the same directory.

To give some answers to the most interesting parts of the emulation:

> The `Process.__new_random_threads__` method generates a random number of threads with random burst times.
> Every one in a thousand times, a thread will have a burst time that is exponentially larger than the rest.
